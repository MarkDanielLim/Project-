           <h1>Quick Hummus Recipe</h1>
      <hr>
          <p><ul>Quick hummus recipe. This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. 
       It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years. 
       Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. 
       It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads. </p></ul>

                     <p><em>Hummus</em> that creamy dip that hails from the Middle East, has a reputation as a clean, healthy food. 
                      It deserves it. All the main ingredients are super foods in their own right. 
                      It's got chickpeas, sesame paste (tahini), garlic, and <strong>olive oil in most traditional versions.</p>

       Hummus isnâ€™t just for dipping. It makes a great sandwich spread, too. Try it instead of mayo. 
       You'll get more protein and fiber for half the calories you would from mayonnaise.
